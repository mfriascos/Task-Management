# Task-Management

**Task management module**. This module will allow users to create and assign tasks, track progress and receive notifications when tasks are completed.

As an example model, I am going to create a mid-level Odoo module called "Task Management". This module will allow users to create and assign tasks, track progress, and receive notifications when tasks are completed.

<h2>Create the module structure</h2>
First, we create a folder with the name "task_management" in the /addons path. Inside this folder, we create the following files:
init.py: This file is necessary for Odoo to recognize the folder as a module.
models.py: This file will contain the definitions of our models.
views.xml: This file will contain the views for our models.
security.xml: This file will contain the user permission definitions for our module.
Define the models:
In the models.py file, we define the models that we will use in our module. In this case, we will create a model called "Task" with the following fields:
name: the name of the task.
description: a description of the task.
assigned_to: the user assigned to the task.
due_date: the due date of the task.
completed: a boolean indicator that indicates whether the task has been completed or not.
In addition, we define the methods for creating and completing tasks.

Create the views:
In the views.xml file, we create the views that will be used to display the Task model data. In this case, we will create a list view and a form to display the task details.

Define user permissions:
In the security.xml file, we define the user permissions required to access our module. For example, we can define a group of users who have permission to create and complete tasks.

Notifications configuration:
We can add a notification system so that users are alerted when a task is assigned to them or when a task assigned to them is completed.

In summary, the "Task Management" module would allow users to create tasks, assign them to other users, track progress and receive notifications when tasks are completed. This is just an example of what can be done with an Odoo module, and the specific details may vary depending on the requirements of each project.
